## 思路
Iterate twice - from the left and from the right. We will remember the index of the last char c that we've seen and append the distance to res[]. While interating from right to left, we will calc the distance agian and compare it with the one in res. Smaller ones would be the final results.

## Code
```Python
class Solution(object):
    def shortestToChar(self, s, c):
        prev = float('-inf')
        res = []
        for i, x in enumerate(s):
            if x == c:
                prev = i
            res.append(i - prev)
            
        prev = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == c:
                prev = i
            res[i] = min(res[i], prev - i)
            
        return res
```
